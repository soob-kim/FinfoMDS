# FMDS

We present a self-supervised MDS approach informed by the dispersions of
observations that share a common binary label ($F$-ratio). Our
visualization accurately configures the F-ratio from PERMANOVA while
consistently preserving the global structure with a low data distortion
compared to existing dimensionality reduction tools. Using an algal
microbiome dataset, we show that this new method better illustrates the
communityâ€™s response to the host, suggesting its potential impact on
microbiology and ecology data analysis.
