\format{
A list of length 2. Each element corresponds to one experimental site and contains:
\describe{
  \item{dist}{A numeric matrix representing pairwise weighted Unifrac distances between samples at the site.}
  \item{host}{A character vector indicating the presence ("+") or absence ("-") of the host for each sample.}
}
}
\source{
Data derived from an experimental study on host-microbe interactions at two sites.
}
\usage{
data(microbiome)
}
\description{
The dataset consists of 36 balanced microbial community samples cultured with or without the microbial host (alga \textit{Phaeodactylum tricornutum}). The community comprised 72 bacterial taxa as identified by amplicon sequence variants (ASV) of the 16S rRNA gene, PCR-amplified. ASV counts were obtained through Illumina MiSeq system and subsequently converted into relative abundances using cumulative sum scaling (CSS). A phylogeny-based metric (weighted Unifrac) and compositional data were used to calculate distance matrix.
}
\details{
Each element of the list represents a separate experimental site.
`dist` is a symmetric matrix of pairwise distances between samples, and
`labels` indicates host presence ("+") or absence ("-").
